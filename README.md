# 3D-test

Ray-Tracing!

This simple renderer can accept 3D models and display them in a first-person environment. Supports textures, and brings fancy lighting.

Once the renderer is optimised well enough, I may use it as an engine to build a game within. For now, pretty reflections and cascading lights
